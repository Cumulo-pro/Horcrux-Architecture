## Enhancing Security and Availability in CometBFT Environments with Multi-Party Computation

Horcrux Architecture approach for running Cosmos nodes

Horcrux is a multi-party-computation (MPC) signing service for CometBFT nodes. It enhances security and availability by distributing private keys among multiple nodes, thereby preventing double signing and improving performance. The project also introduces Raft for leader election and consensus. In summary, Horcrux is a tool that elevates the security and availability of validation infrastructure in CometBFT environments.
